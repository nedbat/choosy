    Programming can be fun.

    Programming requires learning a new language.

    There are lots of different programming languages, Python is just one of
    them.

    TODO:

        - Computers are very literal.
        - Programming involves lots of arcane terminology, just like any specialize discipline.
        - Something early on about indentation errors.
        - Py 2 vs Py 3

    Although computers can do lots of complicated things, they are actually
    quite dumb.  They only do what people have told them to do.  Computers are
    good at arithmetic, and they are very fast, so they can do billions of
    operations per second.  But they are always following a programmer's
    instructions.
    
    Programs are the instructions people give to computers.  When you write a
    program, you are spelling out a series of steps for a computer to follow.

    Programs are written in special languages.  There are lots of different
    programming languages.  The one we'll use is called Python.

    (Install Python... yikes)

    One of the convenient features of Python, not shared by all programming
    languages, is that you can type instructions into an "interactive prompt"
    and run them immediately.

    If you have Python installed on your computer, you can run it and you 
    will get a prompt:

        $ python
        Python 3.2 (r32:88445, Feb 20 2011, 21:29:02) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>>

    After showing some information about what version of Python you have, 
    Python prints a prompt ">>>".

    That triple-greater-than prompt means that Python is waiting for you to
    give it an instruction.  As soon as you do, Python will execute it for you:

        >>> 2+2
        4
        >>>

    Here we told Python "2+2", which it understands to mean, "add 2 and 2
    together and show me the result."  It executed that instruction, and
    printed 4.  Then it prompted you again to give it another instruction.

    Because Python is a programming language, it works differently than
    English.  Lots of things that make sense to people don't make sense to
    Python.  For example:

        >>> 2 plus 2
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            2 plus 2
                 ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        >>>

    Here we used an English phrase that any schoolchild would understand, but
    Python doesn't get it.  It complains to us about a SyntaxError, and
    indicates the piece it didn't like, the word "plus".

    As you experiment with Python, you'll get errors like this. Don't be
    alarmed.  You can fix your mistake and try again.  Programming means paying
    attention to a lot of details, starting with exactly how you express
    yourself in Python.

    Sometimes, Python won't complain, but will give you the "wrong" answer:

        >>> 2 and 2
        2
        >>>

    We'll eventually learn why Python thinks "2 and 2" is 2. It has to do with
    what the word "and" means in Python. It means kind of the same as in
    English, but not exactly the same.

    If you find that your program is causing errors, or getting the wrong
    answer, double-check that you're using the Python words and symbols the way
    they are meant to be used.  Python uses more words than many other
    programming languages, which helps make it more readable, but that doesn't
    mean you can just write English.  It's still a programming language, so you
    have to use it in very specific ways.

    We've seen Python add two and two to get four.  Of course, it can perform
    all sorts of arithmetic operations:

        >>> 2 * 3
        6
        >>> 7 * 11 * 13
        1001
        >>> 1001 / 13
        77
    
    An asterisk means multiplication and slash means division, since the
    schoolbook symbols × and ÷ aren't on your keyboard.  Just as you learned in
    school, multiplication and division happen first, then addition and
    subtraction:

        >>> 2 + 3 * 4
        14
        >>> 100 - 8 / 2
        96

    And just like in school, parentheses can be used to force particular
    operations to happen first:

        >>> (2 + 3) * 4
        20
        >>> (100 - 8) / 2
        46

    When writing programs, you have to deal with values that change over the
    course of the program.  For example, you may be counting the number of
    times a certain event has occurred.  Programs track changing values with
    *variables*.  In Python, a variable is a name that can be assigned a value.

    All of the numbers we've been using so far are values, and we can use names
    to refer to them. To create a variable, you simply give a name a value with
    an equals sign:

        >>> x = 17

    You can then use the name anywhere you can use a value:

        >>> x + 2
        19
        >>> x * x
        189
        >>> x - 200
        -183
        >>> -x
        -17

    Of course, you can have as many names as you like:

        >>> y = 10
        >>> x + y
        27
        >>> z = 100
        >>> x + y + z
        127
        >>> my_other_value = 2
        >>> y * my_other_value
        20

    Names are made of letters, digits, and underscores, and can't start with a
    digit.  Other than that, you can use whatever name you like for things:

        >>> my_fabulous_number = 1
        >>> _sshh_its_a_secret = 42
        >>> THISNEVERCHANGES_1234 = 1234

    If you make a mistake and use an illegal name, Python will give you an
    error, though which error depends on exactly how you messed up the name.
    You can't have spaces in a name (use underscores instead):

        >>> my favorite number = 7
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            my favorite number = 7
                      ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    You can't use dashes in a name, use underscores instead:

        >>> my-favorite-number = 7
          File "<stdin>", line 1
        SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
        
    You can't start with a digit:

        >>> 7_is_my_favorite_number = 7
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            7_is_my_favorite_number = 7
                                  ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    No punctuation allowed in names:

        >>> i'm_pretty_sure_this_is_ok = 1
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            i'm_pretty_sure_this_is_ok = 1
                                         ^
        SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

    Python has conventions for what styles of names to use for different kinds
    of values.  We'll discuss those conventions as they come up. For now,
    everything should be named with lowercase letters with words separated by
    underscores.

    We've seen how to define a name, by assigning a value to a name:

        >>> x = 2

    And we've seen how to use a name, simply by mentioning it wherever a value
    is needed:

        >>> 1 + x
        3

    It may seem obvious, but it's worth pointing out, you cannot use a name
    before it's been defined:

        >>> 1 + xyz
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        NameError: name 'xyz' is not defined
        
    Sometimes this will happen because you have a typo in the name.  Python
    isn't clever enough (or helpful enough) to notice that the bad name is
    actually a spelling mistake for a name it already knows about.  Remember,
    programming languages are quite strict.  Computers are fast, but they
    are dumb.

    We've only used one kind of value so far, "integers", which is the
    fancy mathematical term for whole numbers.  Python's whole numbers can be
    positive, zero, or negative.  They can also be as large as you need them to
    be.  The ** operator is exponentiation (raising a number to a power):

        >>> 9 ** 20
        12157665459056928801
        >>> 9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9*9
        12157665459056928801

    Python integers can be as large as you need, not all programming languages
    have this feature.

    Python also has non-whole numbers, which for geeky reasons are called
    "floating-point numbers" or "floats" for short.  They work pretty much like
    you'd expect them to work:

        >>> 1 / 3
        0.3333333333333333
        >>> 1 / 9
        0.1111111111111111
        >>> (1 / 9) * 9
        1.0

    But sometimes they will surprise you:

        >>> (1 / 49) * 49
        0.9999999999999999

    The reason this happens it that floats aren't precies.  They are just
    approximations to real numbers, and occasionally the approximation becomes
    apparent. TODO: say something more about this, or wait until later?

    Using names and floats, we can solve a real problem.  What's the area of a
    circle with a radius of 2.5?  As I'm sure you remember from geometry, if
    the radius of a circle is r, then the area of the circle is 2πr² (which is
    odd, since any dessert-lover knows that pie are round...)

    We can define r:

        >>> r = 1.5

    For convenience we'll define pi:

        >>> pi = 3.14159265

    And then define the area:

        >>> area = 2 * pi * r**2

    Remember that ** is exponentiation.  Finally, we can see what area is:

        >>> area
        39.269908125

    Notice we didn't need to create the name area if we simply wanted to
    see the value immediately:

        >>> 2 * pi * r**2
        39.269908125

    So far we've been doing simple arithmetic with Python. Of course, it can do
    much more than that, but before we get to bigger ideas, let's learn the
    formal names for what we've been doing so far.

    The numbers we've been dealing with (1, 3.14159265, 1001) are "values."

    The five mathematical operations we've seen (+ - * / **) are called
    "operators."  Python has many operators, and they all have something in
    common: they take one or two values, and produce another value.

    When you combine names, values, and operators into an instruction that
    Python understands, you've created a tiny piece of a program called an
    "expression." When Python runs the program to produce its value, we say it
    "evaluates" the expression.

    You don't need to memorize these terms, but I try to use them when talking
    about Python. TODO: Blah.

    In addition to numbers, Python has another important kind of value for
    working with text.  We can make a piece of text by enclosing it in
    apostrophes (also known as single quotes):

        >>> 'Hi there'
        'Hi there'

    You can use any combination of letters, digits, spaces, or punctuation that
    you like.  In programming terms, those symbols are all called "characters."
    The text value is a string of characters, so it's called simply a "string."
    
    Just as there are operators that work on numbers, there are operators that
    work on strings.  For example, I can use + to concatentate (join together)
    two strings:

        >>> 'Hi' + 'there'
        'Hithere'

    Notice that Python was very literal, it joined "Hi" with "there", so there
    is no space between the two words.  Python doesn't know that each string
    is an English word, so it doesn't do anything special, it just does what
    you asked for, to join the two strings together.

    If you want a space, you can include one yourself:

        >>> 'Hi ' + 'there'
        'Hi there'
        >>> 'Hi' + ' ' + 'there'
        'Hi there'

    Just as with numbers, we can assign strings to names, and then use the 
    name instead:

        >>> where = 'there'
        >>> 'Hi ' + where
        'Hi there'

    TODO: define "code" somewhere

    Most Python programs are not run the way we've been doing it, by typing
    them into the interactive prompt.  Usually you'd put the Python code into
    a file, and running it.

    Let's take our circle_area program and put it into a file called 
    circle_area.py:

        r = 2.5
        pi = 3.14159265
        area = 2 * pi * r**2
        area

    You can run this program from your command-line terminal with something
    like:

        $ python circle_area.py
        $

    When you do, nothing seems to happen!  That's because of a difference
    between the interactive prompt and a program in a file.  At the prompt,
    if you type an expression, Python will print the result for you.  So
    when we typed "area", it printed the value of area:

        >>> area
        39.269908125

    In a real program, Python never prints automatically, you have to
    explicitly ask for values to be printed.  Change the last line of the
    program:

        r = 2.5
        pi = 3.14159265
        area = 2 * pi * r**2
        print(area)

    Now run it again:

        $ python circle_area.py
        39.269908125
        $

    It prints the area! Note the word "print" here doesn't mean, produce a
    piece of paper with ink on it.  It mean display the value on the terminal
    where I'm running the program.

    As we just saw, there are two ways to run Python code: by typing it into
    the interactive prompt, or by putting it into a .py file.  The prompt is
    convenient because you can experiment, and decide what to try next based
    on values you see printed.  Files are more convenient because you can 
    run them again without typing everything in more than once.

    There's a compromise between the two which you should know about.  You can
    create a .py file, and then run it with "-i" on the command line:

        $ python -i circle_area.py
        39.269908125
        >>>

    This runs circle_area.py, but when it reaches the end, instead of stopping,
    it leaves you in the interactive prompt, where you can experiment some
    more:

        $ python -i circle_area.py
        39.269908125
        >>> r
        2.5
        >>> pi ** 3
        31.006276574010307
        >>> area
        39.269908125

    Programs are mostly written so that Python will run them.  But it's
    important for other people to be able to read your programs too.  Perhaps
    they'll want to modify them, and need to understand what the program does
    before they can make a change.  Or maybe someone else wants to read your
    code just so they know for sure what it does. It may sound funny, but even
    you will have trouble reading your own programs once a little time has gone
    by.

    For all these reasons, it's important to make your programs as readable as
    possible.  Python is known as a very readable programming language, but
    it's not English.  Luckily, there's a way you can put English into your
    programs to help other people (or even you!) understand what the program
    does.

    In a Python program, you can use a hash mark (#) to introduce chunks of
    text that Python will ignore.  These chunks are called "comments." Anything
    from a hash mark to the end of the line is a comment and will be ignored.
    You can write whatever you want in a comment, and only people will read it,
    so there are no rules about what can go there, or what is "correct."  

    You should use comments freely, any time you think they can help a human
    reader understand the program.  For example, here's our circle_area.py
    program, commented:

        # circle_area.py, by Ned Batchelder
        r = 2.5                 # the radius of the circle.
        pi = 3.14159265         # the mathematical constant.
        area = 2 * pi * r**2    # the formula we learned in school.
        print(area)

    In the case of a program this small and simple, these comments are kind of
    overkill, but you get the point.  You can use comments to annotate your
    programs to provide any sort of information you think another person might
    find useful.  Python ignores them completely.

    We used the word print to display the area, and you may have noticed we
    used parentheses with it.  Print is a new kind of thing, called a
    "function."  Functions are a way to package up parts of a program under
    a simple name, and then invoke that part of the program by using the
    name.

    In this case, print() is a function provided by Python itself, that takes
    care of all of the details of displaying a value onto the terminal.  The
    value to display is provided inside the parentheses, and is called the
    "argument" to the function, which is a strange word we got from mathematics
    somehow.

    We'll learn much more about functions later, including how to write our
    own.  For now, it's enough to know that like operators, functions are
    a way that Python provides tools for you to use when you write your 
    programs.

    When mentioning a function, I often include the parentheses as a visual
    reminder that it's a function we're talking about.

    Our circle_area program does its job, but it isn't too useful, because it
    only calculates the area of one circle.  To find the area of a circle with
    a radius of 15.3, we'd have to edit circle_area.py to change the value of
    r.

    Let's change circle_area.py so that when we run it, it asks us for the 
    radius of the circle.  To do that we're going to use a function called
    input().

    Input() takes an argument which is text to prompt the user with, then
    collects
