    Lists in Python can hold many values called elements. You create them with square brackets and commas:
    
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 99]
        
    Create a list called my_list here, make it have five numbers in it, some smaller than 10, and some larger than 10:

    def check(t, c):
        with c.expect("""You should have a list named "my_list"."""):
            names = t.names()
            c.test(names, 'You have no variables.')
            if "my_list" not in names:
                if len(names) > 1:
                    c.fail('You have these variables: %s.' % (", ".join(sorted(names)),))
                else:
                    c.fail('You have this variable: %s' % names[0])
            my_list = t.module.my_list
            c.test(isinstance(my_list, list),
                "Your my_list isn't a list, instead it's %s" % type(my_list).__name__
                )
        with c.expect('''"my_list" should have 5 elements, all numbers.'''):
            c.test(len(my_list) == 5, 'Your "my_list" has %d elements.' % len(my_list))
            c.test(all(isinstance(x, int) for x in my_list),
                "Your my_list has some non-number elements."
                )
        with c.expect('''There should be a number smaller than 10.'''):
            c.test(any(x < 10 for x in my_list))
        with c.expect('''There should be a number greater than 10.'''):
            c.test(any(x > 10 for x in my_list))

    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 17]
